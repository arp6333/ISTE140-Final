    <p style="text-align: center">
        The environment in Rainbow Six Siege is destructible. This means some <a class="floor" style="color: lightsteelblue">floors</a>, <a class="window" style="color: lightsteelblue">windows</a>, <a class="door" style="color: lightsteelblue">doors</a>, and <a class="wall" style="color: lightsteelblue">walls</a> can be broken. Doors and windows take 3 melees to break but can also be broken by shooting down. Floors and walls can only be broken with shotguns and breach charges. Certain sections of the floor are called "hatches" and these are breakable parts in the floor that allow you to fall completely through to the floor below. Hatches can be reinforced by defenders. Another part of all maps are cameras which are preset throughout the buildings. Defenders can view cameras at any time but attackers can shoot to destroy them. All maps are available to any game mode (hostage, bomb, and biohazard).
