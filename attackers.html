    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attackers all have the ability to use drone at the start of a round for 45 seconds before beginning the attack. The drone is an RC car used survey the area and to find the objective, the location of which is initially unknown to attackers. Drones can <a class="drone" style="color: lightsteelblue">"scan"</a> defenders to mark their location so it is beneficial for attackers to try and locate not only the objective, but the defenders themselves. Attackers come with two drones: the initial drone at the start of the round and a second drone they can deploy once the actual attacking begins. There are preset <a class="camera" style="color: lightsteelblue">cameras</a> around the map that it is best for attackers to destroy or avoid as to not be seen by defenders while entering. Attackers can <a class="rep1" style="color: lightsteelblue">grapple up</a> vertical outside walls. While grappled, they can enter through windows or hold position either <a class="rep2" style="color: lightsteelblue">right side up or upside down</a>.
</p>

<p class="noformat">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After droning, attackers are deployed at one of <a class="spawn" style="color: lightsteelblue">several entry points</a> throughout the map. In ranked the spawn can be chosen, otherwise it is random. The timer then begins: 4 minutes for normal matchmaking and 3 minutes for ranked matchmaking. Attackers have this time to complete their objective based on which game mode it is. Every attacker has a unique gadget or ability they can use to aid in their offensive. Besides their drones, attackers can also equip a choice of 2 from: <a class="smoke" style="color: lightsteelblue">smoke grenades x2</a>, <a class="flash" style="color: lightsteelblue">flashbangs x2</a>, <a class="breach" style="color: lightsteelblue">breaching charges x3</a> (place on a breakable surface to explode and destroy it), <a class="claymore" style="color: lightsteelblue">claymores x1</a>, and <a class="frag" style="color: lightsteelblue">frag grenades x2</a>. Frag grenades can be "cooked", or held for a few seconds to allow the fuse to burn before tossing it to decrease detonation time after being thrown.

    <b class="title">Gadget:</b> <a class="track" style="color: lightsteelblue">Eyenox Model III x3</a>: Jackal, with the press of a button, can view defender footprints on the ground using a tracking eyewear. He then has 3 charges of being able to scan someone's footsteps, tracking their location real-time. The tracking is not constant, but in in pulses every 5 seconds for 20 seconds. Footprints will look a dark red the more recent they are and fade to green the older they get. Caveira<a class="line" href="./defenders.html#caveira"><sup>(?)</sup></a> is the one operator who cannot be tracked while her gadget is in use. Taking damage creates <a class="jackaldmg" style="color: lightsteelblue">screen static</a> in his vision if the gadget is active. Mute<a class="line" href="./defenders.html#mute"><sup>(?)</sup></a> will jam Jackal's headset making the <a class="jackaljam" style="color: lightsteelblue">screen static</a> as well if attempting to activate the gadget while near a Signal Disruptor.

    <b class="title">Gadget:</b> <a class="candela" style="color: lightsteelblue">Candela x3</a>: Ying can use a cluster of flash charges that can either be anchored onto a surface or rolled out like a grenade. The Candela can be cooked (held for a few seconds before tossing) to delay the fuse. The Candela then <a class="yingflash" style="color: lightsteelblue">fires into 6 separate flashes</a>, each the same effect as a single flashbang. If anchored, they work similarly to Fuze, flashing the adjacent room to where she stuck them. Ying herself is immune to her own flashes from her special goggles, but her teammates are not nor is she immune to other types of flashes.

    <b>Recruit</b>
    <br/>
    Not picking any of the above operators on attack will select "recruit" by default who can equip any of the other types of guns but does not have a gadget like the other operators. He also cannot use attachments for his guns so willingly picking recruit is never a good option. He isn't technically an operator and more of a default if no other operators are available or were not chosen at the start of the round.
