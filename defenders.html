    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before attackers begin their assault, defenders can place <a class="reinforce" style="color: lightsteelblue">reinforcements</a> and set up on the objective. Since the environment is destructible (including floors, walls, windows, and doors), all defenders have 2 metal reinforcements which cover either a wall or a <a class="hatch" style="color: lightsteelblue">hatch</a> to prevent attackers from being able to break them. These reinforcements cannot be broken by any normal guns or breaching rounds. Normal wooden reinforcements have no limit and can be placed on any <a class="window" style="color: lightsteelblue">window</a> or <a class="door" style="color: lightsteelblue">doorway</a>, but these can be shot down or broken easily. Defenders can shoot drones to stop the attackers from locating the objective. Drones can watch defenders and mark their location so it is beneficial for defenders to not allow drones near them or the objective. <a class="camera" style="color: lightsteelblue">Cameras</a> are available to defenders which are in preset locations throughout the map. At any time, they can view the cameras and <a class="scan" style="color: lightsteelblue">"scan"</a> enemy locations similar to drones, but attackers can also shoot to destroy cameras.
</p>
   
<p class="noformat">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In ranked, defenders can choose the <a class="spot" style="color: lightsteelblue">area on the map</a> they want to defend, otherwise it is random. Once attackers are deployed, defenders await their arrival. The timer then begins: 4 minutes for normal matchmaking and 3 minutes for ranked matchmaking. Defenders have this time to stop attackers from completing their objective based on which game mode it is (see Game Mode section in home page for explanation). Every defender has a unique gadget or ability they can use to aid in their defensive. Defenders can also equip a choice of 2 from: <a class="barbed" style="color: lightsteelblue">barbed wire x2</a> (slows down attackers and makes noise when walked through), <a class="deploy" style="color: lightsteelblue">deployable shields x1</a>, <a class="nitro" style="color: lightsteelblue">nitro cells x1</a> (explodes on button press), or <a class="impact" style="color: lightsteelblue">impact grenades x2</a>. If a defender runs outside of the map, they have 2 seconds until they are <a class="outside" style="color: lightsteelblue">detected</a> by all attackers; their icon will then be live tracking them until they go back inside.

    <b class="title">Gadget:</b> <a class="mira" style="color: lightsteelblue">Black Mirror x2</a>: Mira has the ability to insert bulletproof mirrors onto walls (including reinforced walls). The mirror only goes one direction, so operators looking in from the other side <a class="miraclosed" style="color: lightsteelblue">cannot see through</a>. Mirrors will pop out if the air pressure holding it in below it is broken, leaving both sides vulnerable to the <a class="miraopen" style="color: lightsteelblue">newly made hole</a>. The mirror can pop out from an instance of damage on the pressurized canister by a melee attack, a bullet, or a Twitch shock<a class="line" href="./attackers.html#twitch"><sup>(?)</sup></a>.

    <b class="title">Gadget:</b> <a class="lesion" style="color: lightsteelblue">Gu Mines x7</a>: Lesion can place very small mines that inject toxic compounds which deal 10 damage to attackers and limits their speed. After the initial 10 damage, the needle must be Gu pulled out or it will continue to do 8 damage every 2 seconds until removed. This effect does not stack but the initial damage does. The injection causes anyone affected to be unable to sprint and a visual distortion. The mines are camouflaged and practically invisible but can be destroyed the same as any electronics. Lesion only starts with one mine, getting one mine refilled every 35 seconds for a maximum of 7.

    <b class="title">Gadget:</b> <a class="elamine" style="color: lightsteelblue">Grzmot Mine x3</a>: Ela has the ability to toss concussion proximity mines that can stick to any surface. The <a class="ela" style="color: lightsteelblue">concussion</a> impairs hearing and causes a dizzy on-screen effect. Attackers detonate the mine when coming close by. Anyone walking near the mine is affected by the concussion blast, including defenders, but only attackers cause it to pop. Both her and her sister Zofia<a class="line" href="./attackers.html#zofia"><sup>(?)</sup></a> are resistant to the concussion effect. When downed, Ela can manually detonate one more charge held in reserve on herself (does not count as 1 of her 3 charges).

    <b>Recruit</b>
    <br/>
    Not picking any of the above operators on attack will select "recruit" by default who can equip any of the other types of guns but does not have a gadget like the other operators. He also cannot use attachments for his guns so willingly picking recruit is never a good option. He isn't technically an operator and more of a default if no other operators are available or were not chosen at the start of the round.
