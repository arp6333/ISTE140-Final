    <h2>Image Rollover Effect:</h2>
    <p>
    From index.html, the two main images at the top of the page rollover to text and a black overlay.

    <h2>JavaScript:</h2>
    <p>
    None.

    <h2>Summary of My Website:</h2>
    <p>
    I think I did well with the effort put into this project as a whole, I had a really fun time with it so I wanted it to look as good as my abilities could produce. I also think I did well with how the website looks visually, the layout and colors (I think) are visually pleasing.    
    <br/> I think the images positions and sizes could use some work, it was hard for me to line them up how I wanted on each page. The other problem I wish I could fix is the scrolling in attackers.html and defenders.html when you click an icon. It doesn't really "scroll" it just jumps to a section of the page, so if I knew JavaScript I could probably make it scroll smoothly.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Extra:</h2>
    <p>
    I believe I put forth a lot of effort to make an exceptional design with my website. While it is not perfect, I believe the time and energy spent was put to good use and I am genuinely proud of my work.
